## 🛠️ How It Works

1. **Define your data structures** using serializable C# classes (including abstract bases or inherited types).

2. Use the editor to **add fields**, including nested structures or Unity object references.

3. **Create data files** and entries visually.

5. **Auto-generate C# code** and final JSON data files.

6. At runtime, your game **automatically loads parsed JSON data** from the generated file.
