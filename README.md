## 🛠️ How It Works

1. **Create serializable C# classes** to define your data templates.

2. **Add Fields** to the template via the editor interface.

3. **Create a Data File** and start adding entries.

4. **Auto-generate C# code** and the final JSON data file.

5. **At runtime**, your game automatically loads and parses the data from the generated JSON.
